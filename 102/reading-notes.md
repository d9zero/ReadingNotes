# Learning Markdown
Learinging Markdown can serve as a fundamental tool when introduced to coding. Utilizing GitHub as a functional platform, the use of Markdown or .md helps students with:
<ul>
  <li> Understanding the Command Line. </li>
  <li> Understanding the context in which the Command Lines are deployed. </li>
  <li> Build familiarity with the problem-solving that is associated with building a website in html </li>
  <li> Introduce students with functions and features that embed websites with other vital forms of information </li>
</ul>

# Building upon previous experience with Code Fellow' projects

Given the platform *utility* with the markdown language, former projects can be incorporated as well:
