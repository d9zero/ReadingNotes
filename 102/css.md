Ever wondered how certain webpages were diligently put together and aesthetically presented? On those rememberable sites, beside every great wireframe and semantic tag, is a great form of CSS coding. In short, CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element appears to viewers and audiences. With the inherent use of HTML structures are tags for headers, body, footers, lists, and etc. However, in CSS those tags can be articulated into a desired form of presentation; through what is called a selector and a declaration.

Selectors are used to indicate which element the rule applies to, while declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. CSS declarations are incorporated within curly brackets and is designated by what is called a _property_ or a _value_.
