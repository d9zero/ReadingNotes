# Revisions and the Cloud

  To new students of coding, the utilization of several platforms can be daunting at times. However, with ample practice and review, the necessary steps and procedures to collaborate with coding projects are relatively simple in concept.

  The first step in working in the cloud, is to understand the what resources and platforms are viably communicating. In 102, Git, GitHub, Ubuntu 'terminal', and a text editor are the platforms that are coordinating with each other to provide capatable updates. You can find step-by-step procedures in the link below for 'pulling' data from a cloud service onto your local machine, editing files with the text editor, and 'pushing' updates back into the cloud for future collaboration.

  After a while, the process won't seem as complicated. Just remember to consistently update/save your work!
