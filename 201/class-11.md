## Images

Controlling the size and alignment of your images using CSS keeps rules that affect the presentation of your page in the CSS and out of the HTML markup.

You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS.
This is very helpful when you use the same sized
images on several pages of your site.

Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically
using CSS.

You can use a background image behind the box
created by any element on a page.

Background images can appear just once or be
repeated across the background of the box.

You can create image rollover effects by moving the
background position of an image.

To reduce the number of images your browser has to
load, you can create image sprites.

## Example:

    </head>
    <body>
    <div class="wrapper">
    <div class="header">
    <img src="images/title.gif" alt="Galerie Botanique" width="456" height="122" />
    <p>Here is a selection of antique botanical prints held in our collection.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry">
    <figure><img src="images/print-01.jpg" alt="Helianthus" />

Search engine optimization helps visitors find your
sites when using search engines.

Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to
see how many people visit your site, how they find it,
and what they do when they get there.

To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a
domain name and web hosting.

FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your
local computer to your web server.

Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email
newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website
tools (to save you writing them from scratch).
