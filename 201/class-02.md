## Chapter 10

there is a difference between block level and inline elements and how browsers display them. Block level elements look like they start on a new line (h1-h6, p, div). Inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line ( b, i, img, em, span)

### CSS

CSS works by associating rules with html elements. Thes rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration. p { font-color: blue;}

### CSS Chapter 2

A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job, it can store this data in what is called variables.

<ul>Data Types
  <li>Numeric Data Type</li>
  <li>String Data Type</li>
  <li>Boolean Data Type</li>
</ul>

#### Arrays:
 
 An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
