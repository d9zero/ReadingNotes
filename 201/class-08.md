## 

CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for
common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating
printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS
framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.

Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

div elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.

Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
