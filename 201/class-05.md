# In the screenshot

In the screenshots a terminal command in javascript demonstrates how to set an array in a variable. By using the var students = [`x`, `y`, `z`];
each item within quotations is included within the array 'students'. When console logged 'console.log(students);' the console returns with the items `x`, `y`, and `z`. In the second picture, the variable is equated into a array with the use of first name and last name strings. In line 58 it is presented as sayhi(firstName='John', lastName='Doe'){
var username etc..The user input is saved in storage with the return [userName, greeting] command inside the function. On lines 69 and 70, the variable array and use of functions (lines 55-63) is enabled and invoked.
